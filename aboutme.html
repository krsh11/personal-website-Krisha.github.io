		<h3> A little bit about me ...</h3>

		<div class = "container">

		<p> A senior Information Technology student at University of Washington Tacoma.  
		Through my academic career, I have gained experience in various areas of IT including web development, database management, cybersecurity, networking and application development. I have collaborated with my peers in some projects such as building websites and developing desktop applications. 
		<br> <br>

		I am currently doing my internship at Lease Crutcher Lewis where I am exposed to real world IT environment, that allowed me to gain practical experience and hone my skills in troubleshooting and problem-solving.  <br> <br>

		During my free time, I like to read romantic comedy, drama and thriller books, binge watching TV series, long walks in the park or by the waterfront and hanging out with my family and friends.</p>
